<h1>Laboratory work №7</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>
Create command line terminal program with Java and write a class from laboratory work №1:<br>
  1. 5 additional private fields that describe the class the best (in addition to fields in the table)<br>
  2. Methods of access to these fields (e.g. for the field name – getName() and setName())<br>
  3. Static field (of numeric type)<br>
  4. Add 2 protected fields to every class<br>
  5. Fields from points 3 and 4 must represent the class' attributes<br>
  6. Default constructor, constructor with four arguments (first four properties from p.1) and constructor with all the fields. While working  with constructors should redirect call to one of constructors using "this" and avoid code copying<br>
  7. Methods:<br>
    - toString - output information about object<br>
    - static method printStaticField() - output static field value (where Field - field's name)<br>
    - method printField()  - output static field value<br>
    - resetValues(arguments) - changes values of all fields to input arguments<br>
    - The code must be uploaded to GitHub! Repository must contain README and .gitignore files.<br>
  8. In main() method define 3 objects of the class (using different constructors) and ouyput info about them using method toString() and output information using printStaticField() and printField()<br>

  <h2>How to start</h2>
   The program was written on Java 11
    1. Download a zip version of repository <br>
    2. Unpack it to any location convenient for you<br>
    3. Through command line open the repository<br>
    5. Input command javac rally/App.java<br>
    6. Input command java rally/App<br>
